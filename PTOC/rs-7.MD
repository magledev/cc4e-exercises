### Detailed Steps on How the Program Terminates

#### Reading Input:
- `fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin)` reads a line of input from the standard input (usually the keyboard).
- If `fgets` returns `NULL`, indicating the end of input (EOF or error), the while loop terminates.

#### Removing the Newline Character:
- `line[strcspn(line, "\n")] = 0;` removes the newline character if present.

#### Checking for "done":
- `if (strcmp(line, "done") == 0)` checks if the user entered "done".
- If true, the program executes `break;`, which exits the while loop.

#### Error Handling and Conversion:
- `strtol(line, &endptr, 10)` attempts to convert the input string to a long integer.
- `if (*endptr != '\0')` checks if the conversion consumed the entire string.
- If not, it prints an error message and continues to the next iteration of the loop.

#### Updating Maximum and Minimum Values:
- The program updates `maxval` and `minval` based on the converted integer `val`.
- The `first` variable is used to handle the initial case where both `maxval` and `minval` need to be set.

#### After Exiting the Loop:
- Once the loop exits (either by encountering "done" or reaching EOF), the program checks if any valid numbers were processed using the `first` flag.
- If valid numbers were processed (`!first`), it prints the maximum and minimum values.
- If no valid numbers were entered, it prints "No valid numbers entered."

#### Program Return:
- Finally, the program reaches `return 0;` which indicates successful termination.

### Summary of Termination Conditions:
- **"done"**: The user inputs "done" to explicitly terminate the loop.
- **EOF**: The input stream reaches the end-of-file, causing `fgets` to return `NULL`, which terminates the loop.

After exiting the loop, the program prints the results and then terminates by reaching the end of the `main` function, which implicitly or explicitly returns `0`, indicating successful execution.
